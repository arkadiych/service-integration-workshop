# Respond to `OrderPlaced` with a command: `MakeSeatReservation`

- After creating a conference, `orders_and_registrations` should create a `SeatsAvailability` aggregate for it. The ID of the this aggregate can be conveniently the same as the conference ID. See the existing class `SeatsAvailability` and the corresponding unit tests.
- After an order gets placed, `orders_and_registrations` should make a seat reservation using the appropriate `SeatsAvailability` aggregate.
- You can either handle the seat reservation synchronously or asynchronously if you like (even though it happens in the same context).
